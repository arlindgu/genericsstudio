            <div className="gap-2 flex flex-col">
                <p>We’re an interdisciplinary team of designers and developers focused on modern, high-quality web solutions. Our strength lies in the intersection of aesthetics and function. We believe great web design isn’t just about how it looks — it’s about clarity, structure, and a seamless user experience. We’re tech-agnostic but design-driven. Every project starts with a simple question: What’s the core goal — for the user, the brand, the product? From there, we build everything else: design systems, components, content, performance, and interaction.</p>
