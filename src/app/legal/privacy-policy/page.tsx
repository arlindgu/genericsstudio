            protection does not correspond to that in Switzerland, we carry out
            a prior risk assessment and ensure contractually that the same level
            of protection is guaranteed as in Switzerland (for example, by means
            of the new standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission or
            other legally prescribed measures). If our risk assessment is
            negative, we take additional technical measures to protect your
