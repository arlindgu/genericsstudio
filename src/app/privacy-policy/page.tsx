          <h2>3. General principles</h2>
          <h3>
            3.1 What data we collect from you and from whom we receive this data
          </h3>
          <p>
            First and foremost, we process personal data that you provide to us
            or that we collect when operating our website. We may also receive
            personal data about you from third parties. These may be the
            following categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal master data (name, address, dates of birth, etc.);</li>
            <li>
              Contact information (cell phone number, email address, etc.);
            </li>
            <li>Financial data (e.g. account details);</li>
            <li>Online identifiers (e.g. cookie identifier, IP addresses);</li>
            <li>Location and traffic data;</li>
            <li>Sound and image recording;</li>
            <li>
              particularly sensitive data (e.g. biometric data or information
              about your health).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3.2 Under what conditions do we process your data?</h3>
          <p>
            We process your data in good faith and for the purposes set out in
            this privacy policy. In doing so, we ensure transparent and
            proportionate processing.If, in exceptional cases, we are unable to
            comply with these principles, the data processing may still be
            lawful because there is a justification. A justification reason may
            be in particular:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your consent;</li>
            <li>the execution of a contract or pre-contractual measures;</li>
            <li>
              our legitimate interests, unless your interests are overridden.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3.3 How can you withdraw your consent?</h3>
          <p>
            If you have given us consent to process your personal data for
            specific purposes, we will process your data within the scope of
            this consent unless we have another justification.You can revoke
            your consent at any time by sending an e-mail to the address given
            in the imprint. Data processing that has already taken place is not
            affected by this.
          </p>

          <h3>3.4 In which cases can we share your data with third parties?</h3>
          <h4>a. Principle</h4>
          <p>
            We may need to rely on the services of third parties or affiliates
            and engage them to process your data (known as processors).
            Categories of recipients are namely:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accounting, fiduciary and auditing firm;</li>
            <li>Consulting firms (legal, tax, etc.);</li>
            <li>
              IT service provider (web hosting, support, cloud services, website
              design, etc.);
            </li>
            <li>Payment service provider;</li>
            <li>Provider of tracking, conversion and advertising services.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We ensure that these third parties and our affiliates comply with
            the requirements of data protection and treat your personal data
            confidentially.We may also be required to disclose your personal
            information to government authorities.
          </p>
          <h4>b. Visiting our social media channels</h4>
          <p>
            We may have embedded links to our social media channels on our
            website. This is apparent to you in each case (typically via
            corresponding icons). If you click on the icons, you will be
            redirected to our social media channels.In this case, the social
            media providers learn that you are accessing their platform from our
            website. The social media providers can use the data collected in
            this way for their own purposes. We would like to point out that we
            have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use
            by the operators.
          </p>
          <h4>c. Transfer abroad</h4>
          <p>
            Under certain circumstances, your personal data may be transferred
            to companies abroad in the course of order processing. These
            companies are obligated to data protection to the same extent as we
            are. The transfer may take place worldwide.If the level of data
            protection does not correspond to that in Switzerland, we carry out
            a prior risk assessment and ensure contractually that the same level
            of protection is guaranteed as in Switzerland (for example, by means
            of the new standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission or
            other legally prescribed measures). If our risk assessment is
            negative, we take additional technical measures to protect your
            data. You can access the EU Commission its standard contractual
            clauses at the following link.

            accounting and tax purposes.
